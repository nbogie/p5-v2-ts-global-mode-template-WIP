# TODOs for refining this template

-   allow a deploy in which p5 is an external dependency, for small bundle size (see vite-no-bundling.config.js)
-   remove unit testing until I can set it up properly for global mode?
    -   it's just misleading for the user until it supports their code which calls p5 stuff.
