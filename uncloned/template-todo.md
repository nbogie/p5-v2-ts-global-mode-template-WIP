# TODOs for refining this template

-   allow a deploy in which p5 is an external dependency, for small bundle size (see vite-no-bundling.config.js)
-   remove unit testing until I can set it up properly for global mode?
    -   it's just misleading for the user until it supports their code which calls p5 stuff.
- consider adding explainers for each file, in readme or similar, as I've done with  https://github.com/nbogie/p5-v1-js-typechecked-global-mode-starter
- add github CI actions to publish to GH pages?  Perhaps this shouldn't be on by default - wastes a bunch of electricity - but on standby to be enabled easily by  those who need it and are paying attention.
