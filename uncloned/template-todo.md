# TODOs for refining this template

-   allow a deploy in which p5 is an external dependency, for small bundle size (see vite-no-bundling.config.js)
-   remove unit testing unit we can set it up for global mode? (or fix it)
    -   it's not very useful to the user without support for p5 values from p5.
